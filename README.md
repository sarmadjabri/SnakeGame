# Snake-Game
In order to run the code to see for yourself just copy the code from the snake visualization file and run it because it will show a board and the DQN network playing the game as its using reinforcement learning. This is a recreation of snake and a Deep Q Neural network to beat snake

## How to run
If you want to see an algorithm which is more effective play this game then try using the snakebot.py file and run it in pygame trinket(https://trinket.io/features/pygame)
Copy paste the code from that file and run it inside and it should play the game fluently. This applies for all the other python files in this repository.

For the Double DQN Neural network, please open https://colab.research.google.com/ and open a new notebook. Upload snake_visualization.py and the h5 file into the same directory and watch it play :)

Please note that if you run snake_visualization.py, remember that it saves all of its attempts to snake_weights.h5 file and h5 might have issues with the library itself.

The self.epsilon statement controls the exploitation exploration as numbers closer to 1 leeds to more exploration and numbers closer to zero lead to more exploitation.

Thank you for spending your time reading this useless file and please contribute if you find this interesting.
