# Snake-Game
Recreation of google snake and an algorithm to beat google snake.
Source code is not fully mine as I did get help from numerous websites.

The algorithm to beat snake game is a DQN learning neural network of which plays the game several times and saves its attempts.
The Deep Q neural network saves its attempts to disk(hopefully in due time).
The project is using the keras library as it is relatively easy to use.

Anyway feel free to run it but a good thing to watch out for is the amount of CPU it uses Thanks!

I used ai to help a bit :( I understand i pwomise
